title: Five kinds of semantic variation

<div class="message">
people say words // 
words mean things // 
sometimes the same word means different things // 
why's that?
</div>

This is the first blog post I'm making as an official PhD student!

I'm still figuring things out, 
but so far I know my topic has something to do with _semantic change_---how 
word meanings shift over time.
Semantic change is part of a broader category of phenomena I'll call _semantic variation_.
When the same word means two different things, 
that's an example of semantic variation.
Naturally, _change_ is just variation over time.

When you think about the same word meaning two different things,
_polysemy_ (or homonymy) is probably the first thing that comes to mind.
Originally I included polysemy in this list,
but I actually think it's different from 
the kind of thing I'm talking about in an important way.

Polysemy is when the same word can be _used_ to mean two different things.
Take the word _bank_, which has several possible meanings.
If I say to you "let's have lunch down by the bank", 
I could be referring to a `riverbank`, 
or I could be talking about a `bank-bank`---somewhere you keep money.

<!--So what's the difference between *polysemy* and *homonymy*?-->
<!--Both _polysemy_ and _homonomy_ refer a word having multiple senses, -->
<!--but usually homonymy carries the connotation that -->
<!--the two senses are somehow "acidentally" connected.-->

<!--So while bank/riverbank is an example of homonomy, -->
<!--perhaps bank (a physical building) vs. bank (a financial institution)-->
<!--is an example of polysemy.-->

<!--Bank/riverbank is an example of homonymy because it's not possible to be **vague** about -->
<!--which of the two meanings I intended. -->
<!--Either I was suggesting we eat lunch by the riverbank or by the bank-bank, it can't be _kind of both_.-->
<!--On the other hand if I say "oh I hate that bank", I might mean _bank_ in the sense of the bank as a corporate entity, -->
<!--or I might be talking about-->
<!--the physical building, or I might be talking about something that encompasses both.-->

But I'm interested in variation in the semantics of a word _as a whole_.
The distinction I'm making here is related to Herman Paul's 
_occsional meaning_ vs. _usual meaning_,[^1]
or perhaps more closely related to the more recent notion of 
_situated meaning_ vs. _meaning potential_.[^2]
Polysemy represents variation in situated meaning,
whereas I'm talking about differences in meaning potential.
But I'm not too familiar with these concepts yet... 
blog post for another day, perhaps.

Anyway, here's my list of (the?) four kinds of semantic variation:

1. **Diversity** -- differences between speech communities
2. **Style** -- differences between individuals
3. **Change** -- changes in speech communities
4. **Adaptation** -- changes made during a dialogues

### One - Semantic Diversity 

Here's where I say something about _common ground_, 
an idea developed by the psycholinguist Herbert H. Clark 
and others in the '90s[^3].
Common ground is a body of knowledge shared among some group of poeple.
It's related to the concept of 
[common knowledge](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/common-knowledge/),
where everyone knows a thing, 
and also everyone _knows_ that everyone knows it, 
and everyone _knows_ that everyone knows it 
(and so on).

Common ground needs to be _based_ on something---there 
needs to be a reason for everyone to belive we're all on the same page.
For example, 
if you and I were to watch a tennis match together, 
certain facts, 
such as who won the match, 
are _grounded_ (i.e. part of the common ground) between us.
The event of watching the match serves as a _basis_ 
for this common ground. 
This is what Clark calls a _perceptual basis_.

There's another kind of basis called a _communal basis_,
which grounds knowledge between individuals 
based on their belonging to the same community.
For example, 
a nurse may assume that a doctor knows difference 
between a humerus and a femur
_based_ on their joint membership 
in a community of medical professionals.

Communial bases are what we rely on 
to ground linguistic knowledge, 
such as (surprise!) the meaning of words.
In this framework, 
languages, dialects, 
the jargon shared by communites of practice, 
the unique set of inside jokes shared with your immediate family 
or a close circle of friends---all 
these things are the same _kind_ of thing 
as far as common ground is concerned.

So, _communities_ come first 
(conceptually, at least) 
and _languages_ are just the linguistic common ground 
of the speech community.
And each of these communities
(sometimes nested, sometimes overlapping)
may have different or similar understandings 
(or no understanding at all)
of the meaning of any given word.

### Two - Semantic Style 

Usually when people talk about lingustic style 
it has to do with word choice,
or how an individual tends to construct sentences syntactically---the
sorts of things that contribute to tone and register.
But I think there's good reason to belive 
that style is also involved in the meaning of words. 

Here's an example from Barbara Johnstone's _The Linguistic Individual_:[^4]

> I once stayed with my sister during a week when, just having moved to
> a new town, she made a number of phone calls inquiring about goods 
> and services. During one of these conversationts, I heard her begin a 
> response with "Aaahh," a drawn-out /a/ made lower and further back in
> her mouth than the /a/ she used in words such as _father_ or _hot_ and
> uttered at a low and very slowly falling pitch. I at once thought of our
> father, who makes exactly the same noise in the same conversational
> slot in phone conversations of the same sort. _Aaahh_ is a small but 
> unmistakable feautre of his individual way of sounding. It means "I think
> I understand what you've said, and, if I've understood you correctly,
> I'm dissapointed. _Aaahh_ is the beginning of a rejoinder to a statement
> like "We do carry folding directors' chairs , and they're $175 each" or
> "We'll be able to collect your bulky trash in two weeks or so."

Now, Johnstone understood her sister's _Aahhh_ immediately 
because she belongs to a speech community where 
its meaning is common ground (i.e., her immediate family),
but how did the person on the other end of the phone understand it?
A naive view of common ground 
might lead you to think it wouldn't be understood at all.
Not so. 
For one thing, Johnstone describes how _Aaahh_ always comes
with a translation when her father uses it---a 
"synchronic repetition, in a more conventional form".[^5]
So, while there may be no common ground about 
_Aaahh_ itself, 
listeners understand what he means by it 
because there _is_ common ground around 
the meaning of other expressions that accompany it.

There's an interesting question here about whether semantic style
is truly variation in meaning potential,
or if it takes advantage of meaning potential 
to produce a different situated meaning.
My feeling is that stylistic variation 
_can_ have its source in meaning potential,
but something to think about more later...

### Three  - (Historic) semantic change 

New words are coined, and the meaning of existing words change over time,
even within the same speech community.
There's a lot to say about how and why this happens---we 
know, for example, 
that various social and communicative pressures 
contribute to the evolution of word meaning,
and that there are certain patterns of semantic shift 
that words tend to follow.
In a [previous post]({% post_url 2018-03-18-word-embeddings-semantic-shift %}) 
I described some recent work that measures how words changing over time.

I'm particularly interested 
in how other kinds of semanic variation 
influence historic change.
For example, 
it's common far a new interpretation of a word 
to start in a smaller speech community
and gain more widespread usage over time.
Likewise, facets of an individual's lingustic style 
may be picked up by others 
(like how Johnstone's sister uses her dad's _Aaahh_)
and in that way contribute to historic change 
within a community.

Common ground can be useful 
for thinking about historic semantic change, too.
What it means for historic semantic change to have taken place 
(in a given community)
is that the new meaning is available to speakers 
without having to use the dialogue itself 
to create it.
This brings us to the final kind of semantic variation.

### Five - Semantic adaptation

Semantic adaptation is change that occurs over the course of a dialogue.

Every dialogue starts off with some shared semantic understanding---both 
people speak the same language, say.
But the meanings avialable in their communial common ground 
may be rather imprecise.
Or it perhaps there's no bulit-in way of 
referring to some concept that's important 
in the current discussion.
As they converse, 
participants collaborate to refine what words mean 
in service of the present dialogue. 

Here's an example from a psychology-style experiment[^6] 
where participants were asked
to participate in a collaborative challenge 
where they had to refer to some picutres of objects.

[^6]: Brennan, Susan E, and Herbert H Clark. “Conceptual Pacts and Lexical Choice in Conversation,” n.d., 12.

> A: A docksider. B: A what?  
> A: Um.  
> B: Is that a kind of dog?  
> A: No, it’s a kind of um leather shoe, kinda preppy pennyloafer. B: Okay okay got it  

In the remainder of the experiment, 
both A and B referred this card as _the pennyloafer_.
A pennyloafer is (I think) a different shoe from a docksider. 
Perhaps A even knows this,
but because of the collaborative nature of communication, 
the two agree on a new semantics for _pennyloafer_ wich,
for the purposes of this dialogue,
refers to the photo in question.

These kind of agreements---explicit and implicit---let 
us adjust the meaning of words 
in big ways and small.
Sometimes those adjustments persist 
after the current dialogue.
And they may be again introduced 
in future discussions 
with some of the same people,
and perhaps some different people,
and in this way semantic adaptation, 
over time, 
can become historic change.
