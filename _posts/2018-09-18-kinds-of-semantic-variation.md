title: Five sources of semantic variability

<div class="message">
people say words // 
words mean things // 
sometimes the same word means different things // 
why's that?
</div>

This is the first blog post I'm making as an official PhD student!

I'm researching _semantic change_---how the meaning of words shifts over time.
Semantic change is part of a broader category of phenomena I'll call _semantic variation_.
Whenever the same word is used to mean two different things, that's an example of semantic variation.

<!--I'll mostly skip over the question of what even it _means_ for a word to mean something.-->
<!--How meaning is represented, and how those representations are connected to the words themselves is probably effects-->
<!--how words change in meaning, but that's something for another day.-->

<!--Also, when I say _word_, what I really mean is [lexical item](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_item), which -->
<!--includes multiword expressions like "of course".-->
<!--But I'll just note that there are some complications there, too.-->

The thing I like about semantic variation as a concept is that it unifies a bunch of intuitively distinct linguistic phenomena. 
To dig a little deeper I'll give five examples of semantic variation and talk a little about the framework that lets you think of them
as instances of the same phenomenon.

## One - Polysemy & homophony 

- what is

## Two - Different speech communities

- what is
- common ground 
- languages vs. dialects vs. speech community

## Three - Stylistic diversity

People also have their own unique linguistic style.
Usually when we think of lingustic style it has to do with word choice,
or maybe something about how people tend to construct sentences syntactically---the
sorts of things that contribute to tone and register.
But I think that poeple also use words to mean different things on an individual basis.

I'm not sure this example is going to be teribly convincing, but I'll give it a try.
My Dad routinely uses the word _orange_ to refer to objects with hues ranging anywhere from highlighter yellow to hot pink.
I don't know why, exactly. Maybe it has something to do with his chromatic perception.
But you press him on it he'll agknowledge that he realizes it isn't exactly orange.
What matters here, though, is that he's not using the word _orange_ because of some convention in an established
speech community or anything like that, that's just how _he_ uses the word.
And because it's _close enough_ to what people conventionally think of as orange, it usually (with some notable exceptions) works out.

Barbara Johnstone's has an example in _The Linguistic Individual_ that I think fits too

> I once stayed with my sister during a week when, just having moved to
> a new twon, she made onumber of phone calls inquiring about goods 
> and services. During one of these conversationts, I heard her begin a 
> response with "aaahh," a drawn-out /a/ made lower and further back in
> her mouth than the /a/ she used in words such as _father_ or _hot_ and
> uttered at a low and very slowly falling pitch. I at once thought of our
> father, who makes exactly the same noise in the same conversational
> slot in phone conversations of the same sort. _Aaahh_ is a small but 
> unmistakable feautre of his individual way of sounding. It means "I think
> I understand what you've said, and, if I've understood you correctly,
> I'm dissapointed. _Aaahh_ is the beginning of a rejoinder to a statement
> like "We do carry folding directors' chairs , and they're $175 each" or
> "We'll be able to collect your bulky trash in two weeks or so."

- how to explain with common ground?

## Four - Historic change

The meaning of words change over time,
even within the same speech community.
There's a lot to say about how and why this happens---we know that various
social and communicative pressures contribute to the evolution of word meaning.
I think that variation of other kinds itself has a big influence on historic change.
For example, it's pretty common far a new interpretation of a word start in a specific language community
and gain more widespread usage over time.

## Five - Semantic adaptation

Semantic adaptation is change that occurs over the course of a dialogue.
As they converse, participants refite their understanding of what words mean, 
for the purposes of the dialogue,
according to their shared common ground.
The dialogue starts off with some shared semantic understanding---both people speak the same language, say.
Perhaps they are both part of some smaller relevant speech community.
Then, as the dialogue progresses, as words are used and the need arises, they negotiate (explitily or implicitly)
on the meaning of words, so that they are aligned and can express concepts that are relevant to the present dialogue.

- evidence that semantic adaptation is useful
- semanic adaptation as part of historic change
- language learning as a special case of semantic adaptation
