  Hi, there!
</p>

This is my this is my personal site which is also (mainly) my blog. I made this blog because I want to spend more time thinking and writing about computational linguistics (and other things) and it helps to have somewhere I can easily share that work with others.

You can find the code for my current projects [here](https://github.com/winobes) but I'll try and write a blog post about anything that's worth looking at.


## Setup

This website uses the [lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) theme for[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and is hosted by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
