title: Five kinds of semantic variation

<div class="message">
people say words // 
words mean things // 
sometimes the same word means different things // 
why's that?
</div>

This is the first blog post I'm making as an official PhD student!

I don't know exactly what I'm doing yet, but I know my research is going to have something
to do with _semantic change_---how the meaning of words shifts over time.
Semantic change is part of a broader category of phenomena I'll call _semantic variation_.
Whenever the same word is used to mean two different things, that's an example of semantic variation.
Naturally, _change_ is just variation over time.

<!--I'll mostly skip over the question of what even it _means_ for a word to mean something.-->
<!--How meaning is represented, and how those representations are connected to the words themselves is probably effects-->
<!--how words change in meaning, but that's something for another day.-->

<!--Also, when I say _word_, what I really mean is [lexical item](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_item), which -->
<!--includes multiword expressions like "of course".-->
<!--But I'll just note that there are some complications there, too.-->

The thing I like about semantic variation as a concept is that it unifies a bunch of intuitively distinct linguistic phenomena. 
To dig a little deeper I'll give five examples of semantic variation and talk a little about 
_common ground_, the framework I'm using that lets you think of them
as instances of the same phenomenon.

## One - Polysemy & homophony 

- what is

## Two - Different speech communities

- what is
- common ground 
- languages vs. dialects vs. speech community

## Three - Stylistic diversity

People also have their own unique linguistic style.
Usually when we think of lingustic style it has to do with word choice,
or maybe something about how people tend to construct sentences syntactically---the
sorts of things that contribute to tone and register.
But I think that poeple also use words to mean different things on an individual basis.

I'm not sure this example is going to be teribly convincing, but I'll give it a try.
My Dad routinely uses the word _orange_ to refer to objects with hues ranging anywhere from highlighter yellow to hot pink.
I don't know why, exactly. Maybe it has something to do with his chromatic perception.
But you press him on it he'll agknowledge that he realizes it isn't exactly orange.
What matters here, though, is that he's not using the word _orange_ because of some convention in an established
speech community or anything like that, that's just how _he_ uses the word.
And because it's _close enough_ to what people conventionally think of as orange, it usually (with some notable exceptions) works out.

Barbara Johnstone's has an example in _The Linguistic Individual_ that I think fits too

> "We'll be able to collect your bulky trash in two weeks or so."

Later (in chapter 6), Johnstone talks about how this _Aahhh_ is interpreted.
For her, since she's heard her father use it many times, she knows what it means.
But for someone hearding it the first time, since it's not a conventional expression,
a naive view of common ground (i.e., there isn't any) might lead you to think it's not
understood. Not so. For one thing, Johnstone describes how _Aaahh_ always comes
with a translation when her father uses it---a "synchronic repetition, in a more
conventional form".
So, while there may be no common ground about _Aaahh_ itself, listeners understand
what he means by it because there _is_ common ground around the meaning of other
expressions that accompany it.
Perhaps there's also something about the prosity of the expression
that's interpretable on an intuitive level, even without explicit understanding.

Likewise, when my dad gives directions about the location of an "orange" object, even an uninitiated
person is likely to find it, as long as
there's not some red herring (if you'll excuse the expression) that causes confusion.
Through repeated exposure, they'll come to understand that it's part of his individual
style that _orange_ (when he uses it) can refer to pretty much any bright, warm color.

The thing these examples have in common (other than both being about dads... I wonder
what Dr. Freud would say about the proclivity for linguists using their fathers as examples?) is that 
the hearer understands the expression's intended meaning (or at least has resources to interpret
it correctly) even though it's not it's not being used in a way that's conventional to their
shared speech community.
Indeed, even once the hearer recognises the idiosyncratic usage, it remains an example
of semantic style---they don't necessairily adopt it as their own or expect other 
speakers to use the expression in the same way.

On the other hand, for a varitey of conscious or unconscious reasons, they _might_
adopt it as their own, as was the case with Johnstone's sister adoping _Aaahh_.
This is where I point out that all these sources of variation are related.
What was once individual style may become a marker of a particular speech community.
For the speech community, adopting the semantic style of one of their members would
be an example of _semanic change_.

The final two sources of semantic varriation are both kinds of change.

## Four - Historic change

The meaning of words change over time,
even within the same speech community.
There's a lot to say about how and why this happens---we know that various
social and communicative pressures contribute to the evolution of word meaning.
I think that variation of other kinds itself has a big influence on historic change.
For example, it's pretty common far a new interpretation of a word start in a specific language community
and gain more widespread usage over time.

## Five - Semantic adaptation

Semantic adaptation is change that occurs over the course of a dialogue.
As they converse, participants refite their understanding of what words mean, 
for the purposes of the dialogue,
according to their shared common ground.
The dialogue starts off with some shared semantic understanding---both people speak the same language, say.
Perhaps they are both part of some smaller relevant speech community.
Then, as the dialogue progresses, as words are used and the need arises, they negotiate (explitily or implicitly)
on the meaning of words, so that they are aligned and can express concepts that are relevant to the present dialogue.

- semanic adaptation as part of historic change
- language learning as a special case of semantic adaptation
