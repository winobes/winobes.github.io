		Long time no post!

It's been a while... And that's fine, but I've been feeling like there's gap in my available intellectual outlets---something missing between writing papers and having discussions with colleagues.  I'm hoping blogging can fill that gap.

The idea is to cultivate a regular practice of organizing thoughts into text that could hypothetically be read and understood by someone else. To that end, I think it's good to set some guidelines for myself. Naturally I reserve the right to come back and change them whenever the heck I want.

1. **keep it short** -- I'm not writting a teatice here. A post is one thought.
2. **keep it accessible** -- "Keep it simple" isn't quite right. But I want to make this blog accessible to the people who are most likely to read it: My smart friends in other fields who want to know what I'm up to. There's a lot of overloaded jargon in my field. Ambiguity is fine and totally necessary, but I think it's going to be helpful to ground those terms, even if it's in a pretty intuitive sketchy way. 
3. **post often** -- It's just a fact that if I don't post often I won't post at all. I'm going to try to post once a week when I'm working. Usually something I've been thinking about during the week.
4. **let it go** -- It doesn't have to be profound. It doesn't have to be complete. It's ok to be wrong. It's _just a blog_.
