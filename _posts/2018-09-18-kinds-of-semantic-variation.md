title: Five kinds of semantic variation

<div class="message">
people say words //

why's that?

This is the first blog post I'm making as an official PhD student!

I don't know exactly what I'm doing yet, but I know my research is going to have something
to do with _semantic change_---how word meanings shift over time.
Semantic change is part of a broader category of phenomena I'll call _semantic variation_.
Whenever the same word is used to mean two different things, that's an example of semantic variation.
Naturally, _change_ is just variation over time.

Here are five kinds of semantic variation (I hesitate to say **the** five kinds of semantic variation but... maybe?),
and a little about the framework---*common ground*---that brings them together.

## One - Polysemy & Homonymy 

This is probably the first thing that comes to mind when we talk about the same word meaning two different things.
Take the word _bank_, for example. It has several possible meanings.
If I say to you "let's have lunch down by the _bank_", I could be referring to a riverbank, or I could be talking about
somewhere you keep money.
Usually it's possible to tell which sense is meant based on context.

So what's the difference between *polysemy* and *homonymy*?
Both refer to the same word having two different senses, but usually *homonymy* carries the connotation that
the two senses are "acidentally".
I think it can be useful to mark the difference in terms of vagueness.
So, bank/riverbank is an example of homonymy because it's not possible to be vague about which of the two meanings I intended. 
Either I was suggesting we eat lunch by the riverbank or by the bank-bank, it can't be _kind of both_.
On the other hand if I say "oh I hate that bank", I might mean _bank_ in the sense of the bank as a corporate entity, or I might be talking about
the physical building, or I might be talking about something that encompasses both.
So bank (a building) and bank (a financial institution) are an example of polysemy, but not homonymy, 
since the senses are related enough that it's possible to be vague about them in this way.

## Two - Different speech communities

Here's where I say something about _common ground_, an idea developed by the psycholinguist Herbert H. Clark 
and others in the '90s[^1].
Common ground is a body of knowledge shared among some group of poeple.
It's related to the concept of [common knowledge](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/common-knowledge/),
where everyone knows a thing, but also everyone _knows_ that everyone knows it and everyone _knows_ that 
everyone knows it (and so on).

Common ground needs to be _based_ on something. 
There needs to be some reason to belive everyone is on the same page.
For example, if you and I were to watch a tennis match together, certain facts such as who won the match
are _grounded_ (i.e. part of the common ground) between us.
The event of watching the match serves as a _basis_ for this common ground. 
This is what's called a _perceptual basis_ since it's part of the event that we were both there 
and saw eachother there.

There's another kind of basis called a _communal basis_. 
A communial basis grounds knowledge based on belonging to a the same community.
For example, a nurse may assume that a doctor knows difference between a humerus and a femur
_based_ on their joint membership in a community of medical professionals.

Communial bases are what we rely on to ground linguistic knowledge, such as, (surprise!) the meanings of words.
In this framework, languages, dialects, the jargon shared by communites of practice, the unique set of
inside jokes that you refer to when speaking with your immediate family or a close circle of friends---all these things
are the same _kind_ of thing as far as common ground is concerned.

So, speech _communities_ come first (conceptually, at least) and _languages_ are just the
linguistic common ground of the speech community.
There are definitely things left unexplained by this framing,
and I'm interested in exploring some of them.

For one thing, no speech community is homogenious. 
If a speech community is a group of people sharing a linguistic common ground,  what accounts for the diversity of language 
use we see _within_ communities?
That comes next.

## Three - Stylistic diversity

Usually when we think of lingustic style it has to do with word choice,
or maybe something about how people tend to construct sentences syntactically---the
sorts of things that contribute to tone and register.
But I think that poeple also use words to mean different things on an individual basis.

Barbara Johnstone's has an example in _The Linguistic Individual_ that I think fits.[^2]

> I once stayed with my sister during a week when, just having moved to
> a new twon, she made onumber of phone calls inquiring about goods 
> and services. During one of these conversationts, I heard her begin a 
> response with "aaahh," a drawn-out /a/ made lower and further back in
> her mouth than the /a/ she used in words such as _father_ or _hot_ and
> uttered at a low and very slowly falling pitch. I at once thought of our
> father, who makes exactly the same noise in the same conversational
> slot in phone conversations of the same sort. _Aaahh_ is a small but 
> unmistakable feautre of his individual way of sounding. It means "I think
> I understand what you've said, and, if I've understood you correctly,
> I'm dissapointed. _Aaahh_ is the beginning of a rejoinder to a statement
> like "We do carry folding directors' chairs , and they're $175 each" or
> "We'll be able to collect your bulky trash in two weeks or so."

Later[^3], Johnstone talks about how this _Aahhh_ is interpreted.
For her, since she's heard her father use it many times, she knows what it means.
But for someone hearding it the first time, since it's not a conventional expression,
a naive view of common ground (i.e., there isn't any) might lead you to think it's not
understood. Not so. For one thing, Johnstone describes how _Aaahh_ always comes
with a translation when her father uses it---a "synchronic repetition, in a more
conventional form".
So, while there may be no common ground about _Aaahh_ itself, listeners understand
what he means by it because there _is_ common ground around the meaning of other
expressions that accompany it.
Perhaps there's also something about the prosity of the expression
that's interpretable on an intuitive level, even without explicit understanding.

So, the hearer understands the expression's intended meaning (or at least has resources to interpret
it correctly) even though it's not it's not being used in a way that's conventional to their
shared speech community.
Indeed, even once the hearer recognises the idiosyncratic usage, it remains an example
of semantic style---they don't necessairily adopt it as their own or expect other 
speakers to use the expressIon in the same way.

## Four - Historic change

New words are coined, and the meaning of existing words change over time,
even within the same speech community.
There's a lot to say about how and why this happens---we know that various
social and communicative pressures contribute to the evolution of word meaning.

I'm interested in how other kinds of semanic variation influence historic change.
For example, it's pretty common far a new interpretation of a word start in a smaller speech community
and gain more widespread usage over time.
Likewise, facets of an individual's lingustic style may be picked up by others 
(like how Johnstone's sister uses her dad's _Aaahh_)
and in that way contribute to historic change within a community.

Common ground can be useful for thinking about historic semantic change, too.
For example, semantic change is often made possible by non-lingustic common ground.



## Five - Semantic adaptation

Semantic adaptation is change that occurs over the course of a dialogue.
As they converse, participants refite their understanding of what words mean, 
for the purposes of the dialogue,
according to their shared common ground.
The dialogue starts off with some shared semantic understanding---both people speak the same language, say.
Perhaps they are both part of some smaller relevant speech community.
Then, as the dialogue progresses, as words are used and the need arises, they negotiate (explitily or implicitly)
on the meaning of words, so that they are aligned and can express concepts that are relevant to the present dialogue.

- evidence that semantic adaptation is useful
- semanic adaptation as part of historic change
- language learning as a special case of semantic adaptation
