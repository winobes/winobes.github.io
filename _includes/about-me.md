Hi, I'm a researcher in the field of computational linguistics.
This is my academic website,
where I also [blog](/blog) infrequently about things I'm reading and working on.

I'm currently working in the [Change is Key!](https://www.changeiskey.org/) project Nina Tahmasebi .
Before that I was a PhD student in computational linguistics at the Centre for Linguistic Theory and Studies in Probability [CLASP](https://gu-clasp.github.io/).

My research focuses on how we construct meaning through interaction.
As a computational linguist, I try to find ways to investigate these questions using statistical and machine learning methods.
I'm interested in how people align on the meaning of words over the course of a dialogue, and how this adaptive process can lead to long-term community-level semantic change.
Right now, my work is focused on constructing datasets and devising modeling methods that help us investigate semantic change as a continuous process.

In no particular order, here's a non-exhaustive list of topics and methods I find interesting.

* semantic alignment
* semantic variation and change
* fine-grained semantic change detection
* computational sociolinguistics
* word meaning negotiation
* social network analysis
* language modeling for dialogue
