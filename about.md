Hi, my name is Bill. I'm a PhD student in computational linguistics with the Centre for Linguistic Theory and Studies in Probability [CLASP](https://gu-clasp.github.io/) in the Department of Philosophy, Linguistics and Theory of Science [FLoV](flov.gu.se/) at the Univeristy of Gothenburg.

This is my research website, where I also [blog](/) infrequently about things I'm reading and working on.

My reseach focuses on how we construct meaning through interaction. I'm interested in how people align on the meaning of words over the course of a dialogue, and how this adaptive process can lead to long-term community-level semantic change. As a computational linguist, I try to find ways to investigate these questions using statistical and machine learning methods.

In no particular order, here's a non-exhaustive list of topics and methods I find interesting.

* semantic alignment
* semantic varitation and change
* computational sociolinguistics
* word meaning negotiation
* social network analysis
* language modeling for dialogue
