title: Five kinds of semantic variation

<div class="message">
people say words //

why's that?

This is the first blog post I'm making as an official PhD student!

I don't know exactly what I'm doing yet, but I know my research is going to have something
to do with _semantic change_---how word meanings shift over time.
Semantic change is part of a broader category of phenomena I'll call _semantic variation_.
Whenever the same word is used to mean two different things, that's an example of semantic variation.
Naturally, _change_ is just variation over time.

Here are five kinds of semantic variation (I hesitate to say **the** five kinds of semantic variation),
and a little about the framework---_common ground_---that brings them together.

## One - Polysemy & Homonymy 

This is probably the first thing that comes to mind when it comes to the same word meaning two different things.
Take the word _bank_. It has several possible meanings.
If I say to you "let's have lunch down by the _bank_", I could be referring to a riverbank, or I could be talking about
a building where you keep money.
Usually it's possible to tell which based on context (such as where we usually eat lunch).

People have different ideas about the difference between polysemy and homonymy, but usually homonymy carries
the connotation that the two senses are "acidentally" connected to the same word.
I think it's useful to define homonymy in terms of vagueness.
The bank/riverbank example is homonymy because it's not possible to be vague about which of the two meanings I intended. 
Either I was suggesting we eat lunch by the riverbank or by the bank-bank, it can't be _kind of both_.
On the other hand if I say "oh I hate that bank", I might mean _bank_ in the sense of the bank as a corporate entity, or I might be talking about
the physical building, or I might be talking about something that encompasses both.

## Two - Different speech communities

Here's where I say something about _common ground_, an idea developed by the psycholinguist Herbert H. Clark 
and others in the '90s[^1].
Common ground is a body of knowledge shared among some group of poeple.
It's related to the concept of [common knowledge](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/common-knowledge/),
where everyone knows a thing, but also everyone _knows_ that everyone knows it and everyone _knows_ that 
everyone knows it (and so on).

Common ground needs to be _based_ on something. 
For example, if we watch a tennis match together, certain facts, such as who won the match,
are _grounded_ (i.e. part of the common ground) between us.
The event of watching the match serves as a _basis_ for this common ground.
This is what's called a _perceptual basis_---it's something that we both percieved and percieved each other perceiving.

There's another kind of basis called a _communal basis_. 
A communial basis grounds knowledge based on belonging to a the same community.
For example, a nurse may assume that a doctor knows difference between a humerus and a femur
_based_ on the fact that they both belong to the same community of medical professionals.

Communial bases are what we rely on to ground linguistic knowledge, such as, (surprise!) the meanings of words.
In this framework, _speech communities_ come first (conceptually, at least) and _languages_ are just the
linguistic common ground of the speech community.
For example, English is the linguistic common ground between the community of English speakers.
This might seem a little circular, but I promise it's not any more circular than doing it the other way around.

The nice thing about this is that we can also explain differences in meaning that exist _within_ a language 
(as we classically understand it).

## Three - Stylistic diversity

People also have their own unique linguistic style.
Usually when we think of lingustic style it has to do with word choice,
or maybe something about how people tend to construct sentences syntactically---the
sorts of things that contribute to tone and register.
But I think that poeple also use words to mean different things on an individual basis.

I'm not sure this example is going to be teribly convincing, but I'll give it a try.
My Dad routinely uses the word _orange_ to refer to objects with hues ranging anywhere from highlighter yellow to hot pink.
I don't know why, exactly. Maybe it has something to do with his chromatic perception.
But you press him on it he'll agknowledge that he realizes it isn't exactly orange.
What matters here, though, is that he's not using the word _orange_ because of some convention in an established
speech community or anything like that, that's just how _he_ uses the word.
And because it's _close enough_ to what people conventionally think of as orange, it usually (with some notable exceptions) works out.

Barbara Johnstone's has an example in _The Linguistic Individual_ that I think fits too

> I once stayed with my sister during a week when, just having moved to
> a new twon, she made onumber of phone calls inquiring about goods 
> and services. During one of these conversationts, I heard her begin a 
> response with "aaahh," a drawn-out /a/ made lower and further back in
> her mouth than the /a/ she used in words such as _father_ or _hot_ and
> uttered at a low and very slowly falling pitch. I at once thought of our
> father, who makes exactly the same noise in the same conversational
> slot in phone conversations of the same sort. _Aaahh_ is a small but 
> unmistakable feautre of his individual way of sounding. It means "I think
> I understand what you've said, and, if I've understood you correctly,
> I'm dissapointed. _Aaahh_ is the beginning of a rejoinder to a statement
> like "We do carry folding directors' chairs , and they're $175 each" or
> "We'll be able to collect your bulky trash in two weeks or so."

Later (in chapter 6), Johnstone talks about how this _Aahhh_ is interpreted.
For her, since she's heard her father use it many times, she knows what it means.
But for someone hearding it the first time, since it's not a conventional expression,
a naive view of common ground (i.e., there isn't any) might lead you to think it's not
understood. Not so. For one thing, Johnstone describes how _Aaahh_ always comes
with a translation when her father uses it---a "synchronic repetition, in a more
conventional form".
So, while there may be no common ground about _Aaahh_ itself, listeners understand
what he means by it because there _is_ common ground around the meaning of other
expressions that accompany it.
Perhaps there's also something about the prosity of the expression
that's interpretable on an intuitive level, even without explicit understanding.

Likewise, when my dad gives directions about the location of an "orange" object, even an uninitiated
person is likely to find it, as long as
there's not some red herring (if you'll excuse the expression) that causes confusion.
Through repeated exposure, they'll come to understand that it's part of his individual
style that _orange_ (when he uses it) can refer to pretty much any bright, warm color.

The thing these examples have in common (other than both being about dads... I wonder
what Dr. Freud would say about the proclivity for linguists using their fathers as examples?) is that 
the hearer understands the expression's intended meaning (or at least has resources to interpret
it correctly) even though it's not it's not being used in a way that's conventional to their
shared speech community.
Indeed, even once the hearer recognises the idiosyncratic usage, it remains an example
of semantic style---they don't necessairily adopt it as their own or expect other 
speakers to use the expression in the same way.

On the other hand, for a varitey of conscious or unconscious reasons, they _might_
adopt it as their own, as was the case with Johnstone's sister adoping _Aaahh_.
This is where I point out that all these sources of variation are related.
What was once individual style may become a marker of a particular speech community.
For the speech community, adopting the semantic style of one of their members would
be an example of _semanic change_.

The final two sources of semantic varriation are both kinds of change.

## Four - Historic change

The meaning of words change over time,
even within the same speech community.
There's a lot to say about how and why this happens---we know that various
social and communicative pressures contribute to the evolution of word meaning.
I think that variation of other kinds itself has a big influence on historic change.
For example, it's pretty common far a new interpretation of a word start in a specific language community
and gain more widespread usage over time.

## Five - Semantic adaptation

Semantic adaptation is change that occurs over the course of a dialogue.
As they converse, participants refite their understanding of what words mean, 
for the purposes of the dialogue,
according to their shared common ground.
The dialogue starts off with some shared semantic understanding---both people speak the same language, say.
Perhaps they are both part of some smaller relevant speech community.
Then, as the dialogue progresses, as words are used and the need arises, they negotiate (explitily or implicitly)
on the meaning of words, so that they are aligned and can express concepts that are relevant to the present dialogue.
