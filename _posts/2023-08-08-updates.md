title: Updates
---

It's been a while since I posted here, but I thought it's time for a small update.

First, I successfully defended my PhD thesis [_Semantic change in interaction: Studies on the dynamics of lexical meaning_](https://gupea.ub.gu.se/handle/2077/74969) in May.

<p style="font-size:0.8rem;">cover: <a href="http://noahmease.com" target="_blank" size="1rem">Noah Mease</a></p>
</div>

The thesis is a compilation of 7 papers, which collectively try to answer two questions:
1. How does semantic coordination at the level of interaction relate to lexical change on the community level?
2. Why does word meaning change across time and context?

Of course these are _really_ broad and I'm not trying to give a full definitive answer in the thesis,
but the _kappa_ (available at the link above)
tries to relate each of the individual papers in the compilation to those big questions.

The kappa also gives background on the theory and methods that are used in the thesis.
I tried to make a serious effort to write it in a way that is interesting to people who
aren't in my tiny field.
The papers themselves aren't included in the PDF version of the thesis,
but they are all freely available online and are better read in their original conference paper formatting anyway:

* [**Chapter 7**](http://semdial.org/anthology/papers/Z/Z21/Z21-3016/) -- _What do you mean by negotiation? Annotating social media discussions about word meaning_
* [**Chapter 8**](https://aclanthology.org/2022.naloma-1.2) -- _Classification Systems: Combining taxonomical and perceptual lexical meaning_
* [**Chapter 9**](http://semdial.org/anthology/papers/Z/Z22/Z22-3020/) ~ Coordinating taxonomical and observational meaning: The case of genus-differentia definitions.
* [**Chapter 10**](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2303.04053) -- _Describe me an Aucklet: Generating Grounded Perceptual Category Descriptions._
* [**Chapter 11**](https://aclanthology.org/2020.pam-1.2/) -- _Personae under uncertainty: The case of topoi._
* [**Chapter 12**](https://aclanthology.org/2022.nlpcss-1.9/) -- _Conditional Language Models for Community-Level Linguistic Variation._
* [**Chapter 13**](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2021.starsem-1.3) -- _Semantic shift in social networks_

I defended my the thesis on April 20th.
[Casey Kennington](https://www.caseyreddkennington.com) was the opponent,
and the committee consisted of
[Hana Filip](https://hanafilip.com),
[Jakub Szymanik](https://jakubszymanik.com), and
[Dana Dannells](https://spraakbanken.gu.se/en/about/staff/dana).
I couldn't have asked for a more perfect culmination to the last
several years of research and life, so a big thank you to everyone involved.

## Change is Key!

Starting in August of this year I'm working as a researcher
in the [Change is Key!](https://www.changeiskey.org/) project,
lead by Nina Tahmasebi.
Among other things, I'll be working on datasets and models
for fine-grained semantic change detection.
I'm really excited to work with the many brilliant people in the CiK project.
